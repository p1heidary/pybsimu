/*! \brief Class for constructing the linear/nonlinear problem for the
    solver.
 *
 *  %EpotProblem class constructs the Poisson (equation) problem in finite
 *  difference form from Geometry (mesh) and various parameters and it
 *  presents the problem to the Solver via matrix/vector
 *  representation. In case of linear problem (no plasma model), the
 *  Poisson equation 
 *  \f[ \nabla^2 \phi = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \f]
 *  is
 *  \f[ \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \f]
 *  in 1D, which is discretized into 
 *  \f[ \phi_{i-1} + \phi_{i+1} - 2\phi_{i} = -h^2 \frac{\rho_{i}}{\epsilon_0} \f]
 *  using finite differences. In 2D coordinates the discretized form is
 *  \f[ \phi_{i-1,j} + \phi_{i+1,j} + \phi_{i,j-1} + \phi_{i,j+1} - 4\phi_{i,j}
    = -h^2 \frac{\rho_{i,j}}{\epsilon_0} \f]
 *  and in 3D it is
 *  \f[ \phi_{i-1,j,k} + \phi_{i+1,j,k} + \phi_{i,j-1,k} + \phi_{i,j+1,k} 
    + \phi_{i,j,k-1} + \phi_{i,j,k+1} - 6\phi_{i,j} = -h^2 \frac{\rho_{i,j,k}}{\epsilon_0}. \f]
 *  In cylindrical coordinates the Poisson equation is
 *  \f[ \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r}
    + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial \theta^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2} 
    = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}, \f]
 *  where \f$ \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial \theta^2} = 0 \f$ because of
 *  cylindrical symmetry of the simulations. Therefore the discretized form
 *  becomes
 *  \f[ \phi_{i-1,j} + \phi_{i+1,j} 
    + \left( 1 - \frac{h}{2r_j} \right) \phi_{i,j-1} 
    + \left( 1 + \frac{h}{2r_j} \right) \phi_{i,j+1} - 4\phi_{i,j}
    = -h^2 \frac{\rho_{i,j}}{\epsilon_0}, \f]
 *  where \f$ \frac{h}{2r_j} = \frac{h}{2jh} = \frac{1}{2j} \f$ because the 
 *  radius \f$ r_j = hj \f$. At the symmetry axis there is an exception because both 
 *  \f$ r \f$ and \f$ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} \f$ approach zero. By 
 *  using Bernoulli-L'Hopital rule we can evaluate
 *  \f[ \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} 
    = \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r^2}, \f]
 *  which turns the Poisson equation to
 *  \f[ 2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial z^2} 
    = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \f]
 *  on axis. Discretation of the equation gives us
 *  \f[ \phi_{i-1,j} + \phi_{i+1,j} 
    + 2\phi_{i,j+1} + 2\phi_{i,j-1} - 6\phi_{i,j}
    = -h^2 \frac{\rho_{i,j}}{\epsilon_0}. \f]
 *  Here \f$ \phi_{i,j-1} = \phi_{i,j+1} \f$ so that the final form is
 *  \f[ \phi_{i-1,j} + \phi_{i+1,j} 
    + 4\phi_{i,j+1} - 6\phi_{i,j}
    = -h^2 \frac{\rho_{i,j}}{\epsilon_0}. \f]
 *
 *  In addition to the Poisson equation the problem matrix and vector
 *  also contain finite difference representations of the boundary
 *  conditions.  The Dirichlet boundary condition is defined by
 *  constant potential at boundary, i.e.  \f$ \phi_{i,j} =
 *  \phi_{\mathrm{const}} \f$. The Neumann boundary condition can be
 *  defined as first order discretation 
 *  \f[ \frac{\phi_{i+1}-\phi_{i}}{h} = N_{\mathrm{const}} \f]
 *  or second order discretation
 *  \f[ \frac{-\phi_{i+2}+4\phi_{i+1}-3\phi_{i}}{2h} = N_{\mathrm{const}} \f]
 *  selected by the user.
 *
 *  The plasma problems are described by using nonlinear models for
 *  screening charges in the plasma. For positive ion extraction for
 *  example, the screening charge is an electron population at the
 *  plasma potential \f$ \phi_p \f$ with a thermal energy distribution
 *  with temperature \f$ T_e \f$. The screening charge is therefore
 *  \f[ \rho_e = \rho_{e0} \exp \left( \frac{\phi-\phi_p}{kT_e/e} \right), \f]
 *  where electron charge density at plasma potential \f$ (\rho_{e0}) \f$ 
 *  is the same as the total positive beam space charge density for enabling
 *  plasma neutrality.
